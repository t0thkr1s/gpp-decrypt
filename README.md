## üìñ About

Group Policy Preferences (GPP) was introduced in Windows Server 2008 and allows administrators to set domain passwords via Group Policy. However, the passwords are encrypted with a publicly known AES-256 key, making them trivial to decrypt.

This tool helps security professionals and system administrators audit their Group Policy configurations by decrypting these passwords from GPP XML files commonly found in SYSVOL shares.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice**: Microsoft released [MS14-025](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/ms14-025-vulnerability-in-group-policy-preferences-could-allow-elevation-of-privilege-may-13-2014-60734e15-af79-26ca-ea53-8cd617073c30) which prevents new credentials from being stored in GPP. However, existing GPP XML files with encrypted passwords may still exist in many environments.

## ‚ú® Features

- üöÄ **Fast & Efficient** - Optimized decryption process
- üé® **Beautiful CLI** - Colored output with clear formatting
- üì¶ **Multiple Formats** - Supports both individual passwords and XML files
- üîç **Comprehensive Parsing** - Handles various GPP XML formats (Users, Groups, etc.)
- üêç **Modern Python** - Full type hints and Python 3.8+ support
- üß™ **Well Tested** - Comprehensive test suite with CI/CD
- üìö **API Access** - Import as a library for your own tools
- üåç **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## üì¶ Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install gpp-decrypt
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/t0thkr1s/gpp-decrypt.git
cd gpp-decrypt
pip install .
```

### Using Docker

```bash
docker build -t gpp-decrypt .
docker run -v $(pwd):/data gpp-decrypt -f /data/groups.xml
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Decrypt passwords from a GPP XML file
gpp-decrypt -f groups.xml

# Decrypt a single cpassword
gpp-decrypt -c "j1Uyj3Vx8TY9LtLZil2uAuZkFQA/4latT76ZwgdHdhw"

# Show verbose output
gpp-decrypt -f groups.xml --verbose

# Suppress banner
gpp-decrypt -f groups.xml --no-banner
```

### As a Python Library

```python
from gpp_decrypt import decrypt_password, parse_xml_file

# Decrypt a single password
password = decrypt_password("j1Uyj3Vx8TY9LtLZil2uAuZkFQA/4latT76ZwgdHdhw")
print(f"Decrypted: {password}")

# Parse and decrypt from XML file
results = parse_xml_file("groups.xml")
for cred in results:
    print(f"Username: {cred['username']}, Password: {cred['password']}")
```

## üìÅ Example XML Files

GPP XML files are typically found in the SYSVOL share of a domain controller:
```
\\<DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\Policies\{<POLICY_GUID>}\Machine\Preferences\Groups\Groups.xml
\\<DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\Policies\{<POLICY_GUID>}\User\Preferences\Groups\Groups.xml
```

Example Groups.xml structure:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Groups clsid="{3125E937-EB16-4b4c-9934-544FC6D24D26}">
  <User clsid="{DF5F1855-51E5-4d24-8B1A-D9BDE98BA1D1}" 
        name="Administrator" 
        image="2" 
        changed="2023-01-01 00:00:00" 
        uid="{EF57DA28-5F69-4530-A59E-AAB58578219D}">
    <Properties action="U" 
                newName="" 
                fullName="" 
                description="" 
                cpassword="j1Uyj3Vx8TY9LtLZil2uAuZkFQA/4latT76ZwgdHdhw" 
                changeLogon="0" 
                noChange="1" 
                neverExpires="1" 
                acctDisabled="0" 
                userName="Administrator"/>
  </User>
</Groups>
```

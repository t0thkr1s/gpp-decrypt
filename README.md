## About

Group Policy Preferences (GPP) was introduced in Windows Server 2008 and allows administrators to set domain passwords via Group Policy. However, the passwords are encrypted with a publicly known AES-256 key, making them trivial to decrypt.

This tool decrypts these passwords from GPP XML files commonly found in SYSVOL shares.

> **Note**: Microsoft released [MS14-025](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/ms14-025-vulnerability-in-group-policy-preferences-could-allow-elevation-of-privilege-may-13-2014-60734e15-af79-26ca-ea53-8cd617073c30) which prevents new credentials from being stored in GPP. However, existing GPP XML files with encrypted passwords may still exist in many environments.

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install gpp-decrypt
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/t0thkr1s/gpp-decrypt.git
cd gpp-decrypt
pip install .
```

### Using Docker

```bash
docker build -t gpp-decrypt .
docker run -v $(pwd):/data gpp-decrypt -f /data/groups.xml
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Decrypt passwords from a GPP XML file
gpp-decrypt -f groups.xml

# Decrypt a single cpassword
gpp-decrypt -c "j1Uyj3Vx8TY9LtLZil2uAuZkFQA/4latT76ZwgdHdhw"

# Show verbose output
gpp-decrypt -f groups.xml --verbose

# Suppress banner
gpp-decrypt -f groups.xml --no-banner
```

### As a Python Library

```python
from gpp_decrypt import decrypt_password, parse_xml_file

# Decrypt a single password
password = decrypt_password("j1Uyj3Vx8TY9LtLZil2uAuZkFQA/4latT76ZwgdHdhw")
print(f"Decrypted: {password}")

# Parse and decrypt from XML file
results = parse_xml_file("groups.xml")
for cred in results:
    print(f"Username: {cred['username']}, Password: {cred['password']}")
```

## Example

GPP XML files are typically found in the SYSVOL share of a domain controller:
```
\\<DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\Policies\{<POLICY_GUID>}\Machine\Preferences\Groups\Groups.xml
\\<DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\Policies\{<POLICY_GUID>}\User\Preferences\Groups\Groups.xml
```

Example Groups.xml structure:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Groups clsid="{3125E937-EB16-4b4c-9934-544FC6D24D26}">
  <User clsid="{DF5F1855-51E5-4d24-8B1A-D9BDE98BA1D1}" 
        name="Administrator" 
        image="2" 
        changed="2023-01-01 00:00:00" 
        uid="{EF57DA28-5F69-4530-A59E-AAB58578219D}">
    <Properties action="U" 
                newName="" 
                fullName="" 
                description="" 
                cpassword="j1Uyj3Vx8TY9LtLZil2uAuZkFQA/4latT76ZwgdHdhw" 
                changeLogon="0" 
                noChange="1" 
                neverExpires="1" 
                acctDisabled="0" 
                userName="Administrator"/>
  </User>
</Groups>
```
